## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (>= 12.x)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/shivas1432/vapeshop-node.js.git
2. **Install npm Dependencies**:

    In the root directory of your project, run:
    npm install
    

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
     DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=************
DB_DATABASE=social
DB_PORT=3306
SECRET_KEY=a3f17c987ab235c4de06e7d0af30e42a0b9f3e28783f9e3f7d396383b*******8
DB_URL=mysql://root:*********@localhost:3306/social
[use correct deatails for successful functionality]

4. **Run the Development Server**:

    To start the development server and automatically compile assets with hot-reloading:


    npm run dev
   

    This will:
    - Compile and bundle your assets (CSS, JS).
    - Watch for changes in your files and rebuild the assets when you make changes.
    - Start the server locally (usually accessible at `http://localhost:3000`).

### Running in Production

For production, you should build and optimize your assets:

npm run production
This command will:

Minify and version the assets (JavaScript and CSS).
Place optimized files in the /public directory.
Enhance performance by reducing load times.
Project Structure
Hereâ€™s an overview of the important directories and files:

/resources/views      - EJS view templates
/public               - Public files (images, fonts, compiled assets like CSS/JS)
/resources            - can make changes in server
/src                  - routes file
/package.json         - Node.js project dependencies
/webpack.mix.js       - Laravel Mix configuration for compiling assets

Asset Management with Laravel Mix
Laravel Mix is used to compile and bundle your assets. You can modify or add new assets by editing the relevant resources files.

JavaScript Files: /resources/js/app.js, /resources/js/cart.js, /resources/js/product.js, etc.
CSS Files: /resources/css/products.css, /resources/css/payment.css, /resources/css/header.css, etc.
The webpack.mix.js file contains the configuration for compiling and bundling assets.

Example of Usage in EJS Views

<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ mix('/css/app.css') }}">
</head>

<body>
    <script src="{{ mix('/js/app.js') }}"></script>
</body>
This ensures that the latest version of the compiled assets is included in the view.

Useful Commands
Start Development Server:

npm run dev
Compile Assets for Production:

npm run production
Start the Application:

The application can be started on a specific port (by default, at http://localhost:3000):

npm start
